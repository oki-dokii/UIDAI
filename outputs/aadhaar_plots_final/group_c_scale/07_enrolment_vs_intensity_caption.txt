Update intensity declines monotonically with enrolment size, with small districts 
(<5,000 enrolments) exhibiting extreme variance (0–100,000 updates/1,000 enrolments) compared 
to stable intensities (5,000–20,000) in larger jurisdictions. Heteroscedastic pattern reveals 
scale-dependence in administrative behavior and small-N ratio instability (n=642 districts).
