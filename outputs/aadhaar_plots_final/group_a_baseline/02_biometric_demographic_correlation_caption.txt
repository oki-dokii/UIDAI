District-level biometric and demographic update volumes exhibit strong positive 
correlation (r=0.87), indicating that administrative interaction propensity manifests 
consistently across update categories rather than through channel substitution. Each point 
represents one district-time observation (n=500+ district-months, March–August 2025).
