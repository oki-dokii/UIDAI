District-level update profiles reveal near-universal dominance of biometric updates 
(>60% share for majority of districts), with demographic-dominant districts confined to 
low-enrolment, low-update jurisdictions. Trivariate encoding: enrolment volume (x-axis), 
total updates (y-axis), biometric share (color) (n=642 districts).
