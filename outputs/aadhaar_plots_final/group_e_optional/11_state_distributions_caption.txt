State-level distributions of district update intensities reveal substantial within-state 
heterogeneity, with Maharashtra exhibiting both elevated median intensity and extreme outliers 
exceeding 900,000 updates per 1,000 enrolments. Strip plots show individual district values; 
positively skewed distributions indicate inequality (n=districts by state).
