# UIDAI Forecast Visualizations - Final Suite

This directory contains the curated forecast visualization suite following forensic analytical audit.

## Quick Navigation

- [📊 Audit Summary](./audit_summary.md) - Comprehensive evaluation and findings
- [✅ Retained Plots](./retained/) - Core visualization for submission
- [❌ Eliminated Plots](./eliminated/) - Plots that did not meet quality standards
- [🆕 New Analyses](./new_analyses/) - High-impact supplementary analyses

## Summary

**Retention Rate**: 1 of 4 original plots retained  
**New Analyses Generated**: 3  
**Data Limitations**: 4 recommended analyses partially infeasible

### Retained

- **03: Top 20 Districts with Declining Activity** - Identifies complete cessation in 2 districts, actionable monitoring framework

### Eliminated

- **01: National Enrolment Forecast** - Extreme discontinuity, invisible confidence intervals
- **02: National Updates Forecast** - Invalid negative predictions
- **04: Combined Forecast Panel** - Redundant with eliminated forecasts

### New Analyses

1. **Decline vs. Volume Scatter** - Disambiguates denominator effects
2. **State Decline Summary** - Identifies systemic vs. isolated issues  
3. **Enrolment-Update Correlation** - Reveals demand coupling patterns

## Key Findings

- **Two districts** show complete activity cessation requiring immediate investigation
- Geographic dispersion indicates **system-level** rather than regional vulnerabilities
- **Central coordination** required (not state-delegated)
