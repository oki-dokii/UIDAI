**Path**: `outputs/integrated_analysis/plots_final/`  
**Total Visualizations**: 13 (9 Core + 4 New High-Impact)

This directory contains the "Canon" set of visualizations that passed forensic audit standards. All plots have been regenerated to ensure proper normalization, clear labeling, and absence of anti-patterns.

## I. Temporal Baseline Dynamics
*Establishing the "Pulse" of the System*

| File Name | Audit ID | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `core_01_demo_vs_bio_monthly.png` | Plot 1.4 | **Demographic vs Biometric Updates**. Biometric updates dominate system throughput with episodic surges independent of demographic correction activity. |
| `new_01_intensity_growth_rate.png` | **NEW** | **Update Intensity Growth Rate**. Heatmap revealing acceleration/deceleration patterns. Identifies post-collapse recovery and campaign momentum. |
| `new_04_temporal_stability_index.png` | **NEW** | **Temporal Stability Index**. Ranked bar chart of Coefficient of Variation (CV). Distinguishes stable, continuous operations from episodic, campaign-driven systems. |

## II. Regional Heterogeneity & Equity
*Where is the system working? Who is it leaving behind?*

| File Name | Audit ID | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `core_02_state_intensity.png` | Plot 2.2 | **Top 10 States Update Intensity**. Normalized metric revealing distinct administrative strategies (e.g., Rajasthan's demographic focus vs. Karnataka's biometric dominance). |
| `core_03_child_gap_state.png` | Plot 2.3 | **Child Attention Gap by State**. Children are systematically under-represented in update processes across all states (negative gaps). |
| `core_08_demo_intensity_heatmap.png` | Plot 6.1 | **Demographic Intensity Heatmap**. Displays temporal synchronization (Month 3 collapse) and extreme state heterogeneity. |
| `core_09_bio_intensity_heatmap.png` | Plot 6.2 | **Biometric Intensity Heatmap**. Demonstrates operational independence from demographic processes, with unique state-specific campaign calendars. |

## III. Distributional Structure & Composition
*Statistical shape of the data*

| File Name | Audit ID | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `core_04_gap_distribution.png` | Plot 4.1 | **Distribution of Child Attention Gap**. Bimodal distribution indicates fragmented policy implementation and systematic demographic exclusion. |
| `core_05_child_share_scatter.png` | Plot 4.2 | **Child Share: Enrolment vs Updates**. Scatterplot quantifying deviation from parity. High-child-enrolment districts consistently under-update children. |
| `core_06_minor_share_scatter.png` | Plot 4.3 | **Minor Share: Demographic vs Biometric**. Minors are under-represented in biometric updates relative to demographic corrections, suggesting technical or process barriers. |

## IV. District-Level Typology & Actionable Insights
*tools for decision making*

| File Name | Audit ID | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `core_07_district_clusters.png` | Plot 5.1 | **District Clusters**. Identifies 4 regimes: Frontier Enrolment, Mature Maintenance, High-Verification, and Dormant. |
| `new_02_demo_bio_coupling.png` | **NEW** | **Demographic-Biometric Coupling**. Histogram and pie chart. High correlation (ρ > 0.7) implies synchronized campaigns; low correlation implies disjointed service delivery. |
| `new_03_gap_intensity_quadrants.png` | **NEW** | **Gap × Intensity Quadrants**. **CRITICAL**. Segments districts into 4 actionable quadrants. Quadrant 2 (High Intensity, Child Underserved) identifies policy failures requiring immediate intervention. |
